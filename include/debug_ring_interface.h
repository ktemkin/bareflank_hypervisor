/**
 * Debug Ring Resources
 *
 * Each driver entry needs to allocate some memory for the debug ring, and
 * then cast this structure over the allocated memory to access the bits used
 * by the ring.
 *
 * Prior to providing this structure to the debug ring, the memory should be
 * cleared, and the len of the buffer should be set to the total length of
 * memory allocated minus the size of debug_ring_resources.
 *
 * @code
 *
 *  int len = PAGE_SIZE * 100;
 *  struct debug_ring_resources *drr = valloc(len);
 *
 *  memset(drr, 0, len);
 *  drr->len = len - sizeof(debug_ring_resources);
 *
 *  <give to vmm and do stuff>
 *
 *  int ret;
 *  char read_buf[len]
 *
 *  ret = debug_ring_read(drr, read_buf, len);
 *  if(ret < 0)
 *      <report error>
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note there are many different designs for cicular buffers, but all of the
 * designs have to face the same problem. How to detect when the buffer is
 * full vs when it is empty. This design uses two counters the grow
 * forever. The current position in the buffer is then pos % len. If the
 * counters are 64bit, it would take a life time for the counters to
 * overflow.
 *
 * @len the length of the buffer (not the length of this struct)
 * @var epos the end position in the circular buffer
 * @var epos the start position in the circular buffer
 * @buf the circular buffer that stores the debug strings.
